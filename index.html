          <h1>Viking or Slavic Chess</h1>

Viking Chess is an ancient board game invented by the Vikings more than thousand
years ago. The game represents a small group of knights defending their king from
a larger group of warriors.<br/><br/>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>Black knights defend their king (it is located in the central cell - 'throne')
and move it to one of 'rescue cells' while white try to defeat the king.</p>

<p>Black win if they successfully move the king to one of 'rescue cells' (they
are colored as dark red).
White win if they defeat the king before this happens.</p>

<h2>How to move</h2>

<ul>
<li>All knights move like a rook from ordinary chess (horizontally and
vertically)</li>
<li>King can move 3 cells maximum</li>
<li>Knights and the king cannot jump over other ones and the throne</li>
<li>Knights and the king (once it steps away from the throne) cannot be placed
to the throne</li>
<li>White knights are in the 'fortresses' (colored in green) at the beginning
of the game: they can move inside, but once they leave it, they cannot go
back</li>
<li>No knight or king can jump over the fortress cells or go inside it</li>
<li>Only the king can move to corner cells</li>
</ul><h2>How to attack a knight</h2>

<ul>
<li>To attack a knight you should place it between two your knights
(horizontally or vertically) - then it is considered killed and is taken
away from the board</li>
<li>King can attack too</li>
<li>A knight can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and a
corner cell</li>
<li>It can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and an empty
throne</li>
<li>Note, that if a knight itself moves to the 'under attack' position it
is not killed</li>
<li>There's a special attack on the black knight defending the king: if a
black knight is between two white knights (it moved there itself so it's
not killed) and it has a king from the 3-rd side, then it can be killed
by a white knight that moves to it's 4-th side (so that it is now
surrounded by white knights from 3 sides and black king from the forth
side)</li>
</ul><h2>How to attack the king</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the king is in the throne it need to be surrounded from all 4 sides
to be defeated</li>
<li>If the king is near the throne (it's a neighbor cell) then it should
be surrounded from all other 3 sides to be defeated</li>
<li>In all other situations it should be placed between two other knights</li>
</ul><h2>The king is attacked, what next</h2>

<p>If white attacked the king, black have only 1 move to rescue him.
If they fail, white wins.</p>

<h2>Game types</h2>

<ul>
<li>9 x 9 - Tablut (also Tablot, Dablot)
The king should reach any corner cell to win</li>
<li>13 x 13 - Hnefatafl (also Halatafl, Tanntafl)
The king need to reach any border cell (except white fortress cells)</li>
