Viking or Slavic Chess
======================

Target
------
Black knights defend their king (it is located in the central cell - 'throne')
and move it to one of 'rescue cells' while white try to defeat the king.

Black win if they successfully move the king to one of 'rescue cells' (they
are colored as dark red).
White win if they defeat the king before this happens.

How to move
-----------
- All knights move like a rook from ordinary chess (horizontally and
  vertically)
- King can move 3 cells maximum
- Knights and the king cannot jump over other ones and the throne
- Knights and the king (once it steps away from the throne) cannot be placed
  to the throne
- White knights are in the 'fortresses' (colored in green) at the beginning
  of the game: they can move inside, but once they leave it, they cannot go
  back
- No knight or king can jump over the fortress cells or go inside it
- Only the king can move to corner cells

How to attack a knight
----------------------
- To attack a knight you should place it between two your knights
  (horizontally or vertically) - then it is considered killed and is taken
  away from the board
- King can attack too
- A knight can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and a
  corner cell
- It can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and an empty
  throne
- Note, that if a knight itself moves to the 'under attack' position it
  is not killed
- These's a special attack on the black knight defending the king: if a
  black knight is between two white knights (it moved there itself so it's
  not killed) and it has a king from the 3-rd side, then it can be killed
  by a white knight that moves to it's 4-th side (so that it is now
  surrounded by white knights from 3 sides and black king from the forth
  side)

How to attack the king
----------------------
- If the king is in the throne it need to be surrounded from all 4 sides
  to be defeated
- If the king is near the throne (it's a neighbour cell) then it should
  be surrounded from all other 3 sides to be defeated
- In all other situations it should be placed between two other knights

The king is attacked, what next
-------------------------------
If white attacked the king, black have only 1 move to rescue him.
If they fail, white wins.
