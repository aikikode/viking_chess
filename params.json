{"name":"Viking Chess","body":"Viking or Slavic Chess\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTarget\r\n------\r\nBlack knights defend their king (it is located in the central cell - 'throne')\r\nand move it to one of 'rescue cells' while white try to defeat the king.\r\n\r\nBlack win if they successfully move the king to one of 'rescue cells' (they\r\nare colored as dark red).\r\nWhite win if they defeat the king before this happens.\r\n\r\nHow to move\r\n-----------\r\n- All knights move like a rook from ordinary chess (horizontally and\r\n  vertically)\r\n- King can move 3 cells maximum\r\n- Knights and the king cannot jump over other ones and the throne\r\n- Knights and the king (once it steps away from the throne) cannot be placed\r\n  to the throne\r\n- White knights are in the 'fortresses' (colored in green) at the beginning\r\n  of the game: they can move inside, but once they leave it, they cannot go\r\n  back\r\n- No knight or king can jump over the fortress cells or go inside it\r\n- Only the king can move to corner cells\r\n\r\nHow to attack a knight\r\n----------------------\r\n- To attack a knight you should place it between two your knights\r\n  (horizontally or vertically) - then it is considered killed and is taken\r\n  away from the board\r\n- King can attack too\r\n- A knight can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and a\r\n  corner cell\r\n- It can be killed by placing it between an opposite knight and an empty\r\n  throne\r\n- Note, that if a knight itself moves to the 'under attack' position it\r\n  is not killed\r\n- There's a special attack on the black knight defending the king: if a\r\n  black knight is between two white knights (it moved there itself so it's\r\n  not killed) and it has a king from the 3-rd side, then it can be killed\r\n  by a white knight that moves to it's 4-th side (so that it is now\r\n  surrounded by white knights from 3 sides and black king from the forth\r\n  side)\r\n\r\nHow to attack the king\r\n----------------------\r\n- If the king is in the throne it need to be surrounded from all 4 sides\r\n  to be defeated\r\n- If the king is near the throne (it's a neighbor cell) then it should\r\n  be surrounded from all other 3 sides to be defeated\r\n- In all other situations it should be placed between two other knights\r\n\r\nThe king is attacked, what next\r\n-------------------------------\r\nIf white attacked the king, black have only 1 move to rescue him.\r\nIf they fail, white wins.\r\n\r\nGame types\r\n----------\r\n - 9 x 9 - Tablut (also Tablot, Dablot)\r\n   The king should reach any corner cell to win\r\n - 13 x 13 - Hnefatafl (also Halatafl, Tanntafl)\r\n   The king need to reach any border cell (except white fortress cells)\r\n\r\nHistory and Rules (in Russian)\r\n------------------------------\r\n- http://aagenielsen.dk/hnefatafl_rules_russian.html\r\n- http://vikings.fantasyland.info/tavlei.html\r\n- http://skyruk.livejournal.com/246910.html\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
